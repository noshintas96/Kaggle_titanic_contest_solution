# Titanic Kaggle Competition Solution

This repository contains code and documentation for participating in the Titanic Kaggle competition, where the goal is to predict the survival status of passengers based on various features.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not during the sinking of the Titanic.

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection

- Obtain the training and test datasets provided by Kaggle.

### 2. Data Analysis and Exploration

- Analyze the data to understand its structure, features, and distribution.
- Explore patterns and correlations between features to identify potential predictors of survival.

### 3. Data Cleansing and Preparation

- Convert text values to integers for modeling.
- Fill in missing values using appropriate techniques.
- Group ranges of values for categorical features.
- Eliminate irrelevant features that may not contribute significantly to the model.
- Create new features that may enhance the predictive power of the model.

### 4. Model Building

- Build multiple machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, etc.
- Train the models using the prepared training dataset.
- Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

### 5. Model Evaluation

- Test the trained models using the test dataset.
- Compare the prediction accuracy of each model.
- Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model for classification tasks using the Titanic dataset. By following a systematic approach of data analysis, preparation, and model building, we aim to create a robust predictive model that accurately predicts survival status.
